# raise-pr

Take a ready change from working tree to a merged PR — cleanly and consistently.

It branches, writes a commit in **the repo's own convention**, pushes, opens a PR with a
body drafted from the **actual diff + verification**, watches CI, and **squash-merges
when green**. Direct-to-main, artifact commits, and red merges are hard gates, not vibes.

General and portable — it reads each repo's `git log` and follows that style rather than
imposing one. Optionally pairs with **`ship-check`** for the pre-PR quality gate when a
repo has it set up; this skill owns the git/GitHub mechanics either way.

## Install

```
npx skills add hiteshbandhu/skills-i-use --skill raise-pr
```

## Use

```
raise a PR for this
@raise-pr — squash-merge when CI is green
pr this but hold the merge for me
```

Invoke with `@raise-pr` in chat or `/raise-pr` in Agent mode.

## Safety

Performs outward-facing actions (push, open PR, merge) — **confirms before each**, and
**never merges on red or unverified CI**. `--admin` bypass of branch protection is used
only when you own the repo and explicitly approve.

## Pair with

- **`ship-check`** — lint/typecheck/test/secret-scan gate before you raise.
- **`ui-ux`** — verify UI changes before the PR.
