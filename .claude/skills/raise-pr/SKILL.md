description: >
  Take a ready change from working tree to merged PR — branch, commit, push, open PR with
  a body drafted from the diff, watch CI, and squash-merge when green. General and
  portable: follows each repo's own commit/branch convention rather than imposing one.
  Never commits, pushes, or merges without explicit confirmation. Triggers on "raise a
  PR", "open a PR", "pr this", "push and pr", "ship this PR", "merge when green",
  "commit and open a pr".

# Raise PR — change → merged PR, cleanly

Drives the whole path from a ready working tree to a squash-merged PR, following
each repo's own conventions. General and portable — no project-specific assumptions.
Optionally pairs with **`ship-check`** for the pre-PR quality gate when a repo has it
set up; this skill owns the git/GitHub mechanics either way.

**This skill performs outward-facing actions (push, open PR, merge). Confirm
before each: committing, pushing/opening the PR, and merging. Never merge on red
or unverified CI.**

Works with any coding agent that has `git` + `gh` (GitHub CLI, authenticated).

**Supporting files:**
- [pr-body-template.md](pr-body-template.md) — the PR description structure

Output: `{SKILL_OUTPUT_DIR}/raise-pr/` (optional run log) — see [../OUTPUT.md](../OUTPUT.md)

## Conventions — detect per repo, then match

This is a **general, portable** skill — it works on any repo and must not impose a
personal style. **First read the repo's recent `git log --oneline -15` (and a merged
PR or two) and follow whatever convention it already uses**: commit format, scope
style, trailer presence, branch naming, merge strategy. The repo's own history wins.

Only when the repo gives no clear signal, fall back to these sensible defaults:

| Thing | Fallback (used only if the repo has no clear convention) |
|-------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| Commit format | Conventional + scoped — `type(scope): summary` (`feat`, `fix`, `chore`, `refactor`, `docs`, `test`) |
| Subject | Specific; multiple changes → comma-separated, never "various fixes" |
| Body | What + why, plain prose, 1–3 sentences |
| Co-author trailer | Match the repo — include one only if its history already uses one |
| Branch | `type/kebab-descriptive`, derived from the change |
| Merge | Squash, delete branch, gated on green CI |

---

## Ask the user when unsure — don't guess

Confirmations before commit / push / merge are always required. Beyond those, **stop
and ask** (a short, specific question — offer a recommended default) whenever:

- **Scope is mixed** — the diff spans unrelated concerns. Ask whether to split into
  separate commits/PRs, and which to include now.
- **Type/scope is genuinely ambiguous** — e.g. `feat` vs `fix`, or no obvious scope.
  Propose your best guess and confirm rather than silently picking.
- **Base branch isn't obvious** — repo uses `develop`/`release` branches, or the
  default isn't clearly the right target. Ask which base to PR against.
- **No clear repo convention** and it matters (commit style, trailer, squash vs merge).
  Ask which to follow instead of imposing a default.
- **Merge intent is unstated** — "raise a PR" doesn't say whether to merge. Default to
  **opening and holding**; ask before merging unless they said "merge when green."
- **CI is red** — ask whether to fix now, hold, or abandon. Never merge around it.
- **Branch protection blocks the merge** — never `--admin`-bypass without asking; confirm
  the user owns the repo and wants the policy overridden.
- **Anything destructive or irreversible** — force-push, history rewrite, deleting a
  shared branch.

Ask once, batch related questions, and proceed on the answer — don't re-litigate.

## Step 0 — Preconditions (hard gates)

Refuse to proceed and explain if any fail:

1. **Quality gate** — the repo's tests/lint/typecheck should be green before opening a
   PR. Run them however *this* repo does it. (`ship-check` is one repo-aware way to run
   that gate if it's set up here — but it's optional, not a dependency of this skill.)
   Don't open a PR on a known-broken tree.
2. **Not on the default branch** — never commit straight to `main`/`master`.
   If on it, Step 1 creates a branch.
3. **Clean of artifacts** — no screenshots, `skill-outputs/`, build output, `.env`,
   or stray binaries staged. If present, offer to gitignore them; do not commit them.
4. **`gh` authenticated** — `gh auth status` succeeds; remote is GitHub.

---

## Step 1 — Branch

- Read `git log --oneline -8` to learn the repo's actual commit/branch convention.
- If on the default branch, create `type/kebab-descriptive` where `type` matches the
  change and the slug summarizes it (`fix/task-dropdowns-doc-edits`).
- If already on a feature branch, reuse it.

---

## Step 2 — Commit

1. **Derive `type` + `scope`** from the diff:
   - `type`: `feat` (new capability), `fix` (bug), `refactor`, `docs`, `test`, `chore`.
   - `scope`: the dominant top-level area touched (e.g. `tasks`, `matters`, `mcp`).
     Multiple areas → slash-joined (`tasks/mcp/docs`) or the umbrella scope.
3. **Subject**: imperative, specific. If the change does several things, list them
   comma-separated rather than going vague.
4. **Body**: 1–3 sentences — what changed and *why*. Add a co-author trailer only if
   the repo's history uses one.
5. **Show the proposed message and the `git status` and confirm before committing.**

---

## Step 3 — Push + open PR

1. Push the branch (`git push -u origin <branch>`).
2. Draft the PR body from [pr-body-template.md](pr-body-template.md), filled from the
   actual diff and the verification you ran (test counts, Playwright, etc.) — not
   boilerplate. Title = the commit subject (or an umbrella summary for multi-commit).
3. `gh pr create --base <default> --head <branch>`. Show the URL.

---

## Step 4 — Watch CI

- Start `gh pr checks <n> --watch` (background it for long runs).
- On **red**: stop, surface the failing job + log link, do not merge. Offer to fix.
- On **green**: confirm `gh pr view <n> --json mergeStateStatus` is `CLEAN` before Step 5.

---

## Step 5 — Merge (only on explicit go + green CI)

- **Squash-merge + delete branch**: `gh pr merge <n> --squash --delete-branch`.
- If branch protection blocks (required review / pending check): surface exactly why.
  Only use `--admin` when the user owns the repo **and** explicitly approves bypassing.
- After merge: `git checkout <default> && git pull --ff-only`; report the squash commit.

---

## Step 6 — Report

PR URL · CI result · squash commit on default · branch deleted · default synced.
If anything was skipped (e.g. merge held for review), say so plainly.

---

## Why this beats the ad-hoc flow

- **No direct-to-main, no artifact commits, no red merges** — they're hard gates, not vibes.
- **Conventional scope + branch name derived from the diff** — consistent history without thinking about it.
- **PR body written from the real diff + verification** — reviewers get signal, not a template.
- **CI-gated squash-merge** — one clean commit per PR on `main`, every time.

---

## Edge cases

- **No `gh`** — do branch + commit + push; print the PR "create" URL for the user to open manually.
- **Multiple logical changes** — suggest splitting into separate commits/PRs; don't bundle unrelated work.
- **Already-open PR for this branch** — update it (push), don't open a duplicate.
- **Non-GitHub remote** — handle commit/push; PR/merge steps are GitHub-specific, note the limitation.
- **User says "just commit, don't PR"** — stop after Step 2.

---

## Invocation examples

```
raise a PR for this
@raise-pr — squash-merge when CI is green
commit and open a pr, then merge once green
pr this but hold the merge for me
```

## Pair with

- **`ship-check`** — run first for the lint/typecheck/test/secret-scan gate.
- **`ui-ux`** — for UI changes, verify before raising the PR.
